# Autonomous Car Racing Simulation

## Overview

This repository is planned to extend the functionality of a [single Ackermann-steering car simulation](https://github.com/BalazsPh21/ackermann_simulation) by introducing a multi-agent environment where two or more autonomous cars can race against each other. Providing a place for you to develop your own planning, control and other packages.
